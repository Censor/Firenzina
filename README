Firenzina 2.2.2 xTreme is a free, open-source UCI chess engine by Yuri Censor (Dmitri Gusev), 
a clone of Fire 2.2 xTreme by Kranium (Norman Schmidt),
a derivative (via Fire) of FireBird by Kranium (Norman Schmidt) and Sentinel (Milos Stanisavljevic),
based on (via Fire and FireBird) IppoLit engines
by Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, Igor Igorovich Igoronov, Roberto Pescatore,
Yusuf Ralf Weisskopf, Ivan Skavinsky Skavar and all Decembrists.

Rededication: To the memories of Giovanna Tornabuoni and Domenico Ghirlandaio added.

Firenzina 2.2.2 xTreme
Following the advice of Jose Velasco (Velmarin), switched to _mm_popcnt_u64() from <nmmintrin.h>.
In order to improve xTreme configurability, allowed up to twice as many threads as there are 
processors (CPUs) reported. (Hyperthreaded designs report twice as many CPUs as cores. 
For example, my Core i7 quad reports having 8 processors. Then the default NumThreads is now set to 
8<<1 = 16. Limit by setting Max_Threads to a lower value than the default 64. In the past, 
there was no way to have more threads than CPUs.)

Compiled using Intel C++ 13.0 Update 3 (Feb. 6, 2013) under Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2012 Update 1.
Added a new Firenzina logo based on a fragment of the classic portrait of Giovanna Tuornabuoni 
by Domenico Ghirlandaio (public domain). Released on February 25, 2013, under
